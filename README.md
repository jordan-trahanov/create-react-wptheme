# Create React WP Theme <!-- omit in toc -->

## Still Up To Date!

May 6, 2020
<br />
Just wanted to note that version [v3.4.1](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/releases/tag/v3.4.1) of [Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/) is still the latest.

If you have a theme made with an earlier version of `create-react-wptheme` and want to update it to the latest code, [just follow these instructions](#updating-existing-themes).

## Getting Started <!-- omit in toc -->

[Michael Soriano](https://github.com/michaelsoriano) is writing a tutorial for creating a theme using React. He uses `create-react-wptheme` for the initial setup. He provides a lot more detail than this `readme` and the screen shots are really helpful.

## Creating a New Theme

To create a WordPress theme using `create-react-wptheme`, follow these steps.

- Make sure your WordPress server is up and running.
- Change dir into your WordPress themes folder (**this is just an example, use your real themes folder**).
  - Windows: `cd C:\xampp\htdocs\wordpress\wp-content\themes`
  - Mac or \*nix: `cd /xampp/htdocs/wordpress/wp-content/themes`
- Use `npx create-react-wptheme` to make a new theme
  - For example: (**replace "my_react_theme" with whatever you want your theme to be named**):
  - `npx create-react-wptheme my_react_theme`
    - If you want to use TypeScript, then the command would be:
    - `npx create-react-wptheme my_react_theme --typescript`
- When it finishes it'll tell you to change into your new theme's folder and run the Nodejs watcher (replace "my_react_theme" with the same name you used in the previous step):
  - `cd my_react_theme/react-src`
  - `npm run start`
- That sets up the theme so that it can be seen in the WordPress admin area.
  - **Go there now and set your WordPress site to use this theme.**
- View the site in your browser with the new theme.
  - **You must do this as it does some extra setup via PHP.**
  - **If you get PHP errors, most likely your web server doesn't have write access to your theme.**
    - Write access for your web server is only needed during this setup step.
    - **You can revoke write access after the setup has completed.**
    - Interested (paranoid?) about what it's doing? Check out the file: `<Your Theme's Root Folder>/index.php`
  - When that's done you'll see: `Now, back in your command prompt, rerun the "start" script again...`
  - To do that, go back to your command prompt where you first ran `npm run start` and rerun that same command again.
- In a few seconds you should see your browser load with the standard create-react-app page, but it's running as a WordPress theme!

## Updating Existing Themes

When new versions of `Create-React-WPTheme` are released, you can easily upgrade an existing theme using a single command.

- At a command prompt, navigate to your theme's `react-src` folder.
  - e.g. `<Your Theme's Root Folder>/react-src`
- If you use `npm` then run this command:
  - `npm install @canufeelit/react-scripts-wptheme@latest`
- If you use `yarn` then run this command:
  - `yarn add @canufeelit/react-scripts-wptheme@latest`

### Updating TypeScript Types

If your theme uses TypeScript, you'll need to modify the theme's `react-app-env.d.ts` file:

- Navigate to the `<Your Theme's Root Folder>/react-src/src` folder.
- Open the `react-app-env.d.ts` file in your editor of choice.
- Change the line in there to read (be sure to include the leading three slashes):
  - `/// <reference types="@canufeelit/react-scripts-wptheme" />`
- Save the change and you should be all set.

## Developing Your Theme

### React Tutorials

If you're looking at a React tutorial on the web, you can use `create-react-wptheme` in place of `create-react-app`.
<br>But you do have to remember that the React app code is one extra folder down inside your theme folder.
<br>Notice that the final folder in this path is `react-src`:

`/xampp/htdocs/wordpress/wp-content/themes/<Your Theme's Root Folder>/react-src`

So for example, if the tutorial instructs you to edit the `src/App.js` file, then for you, that file would actually be located at:

`<Your Theme's Root Folder>/react-src/src/App.js`

### The Public Folder

The authors of the original `create-react-app` say that using the "Public" folder (found at `react-src/public` in your new theme's folder) is a last ditch "escape hatch" for adding otherwise-hard-to-deal-with files.

But for this project, I've decided to use it for all things that you'd put into a normal WordPress theme (e.g. functions.php, etc.). So any PHP, hard-coded CSS, and/or hard-coded JS (like other JS libraries that you'd like to reference globally (I don't judge)), can go into the public folder.

**In addition, any changes made to CSS, JS, and PHP files in the Public folder will cause a rebuild to happen.** Which is unlike `create-react-app` which ignores most of the files in the Public folder.

### Dev Configuration

After you've created a new theme, and all the setup is done, you'll find a file named `react-src/user.dev.json` that has some configuration options that you can mess with if you need to.

### HTTPS/SSL Support

If you develop using SSL (i.e. HTTPS), then you might want to run the `Browser Refresh Server` under SSL as well. Especially if you use Firefox, see here: [Firefox Websocket security issue](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11768221/firefox-websocket-security-issue).

To configure the `Browser Refresh Server` to use SSL, follow these steps:

- Assuming you've already created a theme using `create-react-wptheme`, change directory into the `react-src` folder in your theme's folder
  - Be sure to follow **all the instructions** under the **Usage** section at the top of this document. You need to complete the PHP portion of the setup before you can configure SSL.
  - Windows example: `cd C:\xampp\htdocs\wordpress\wp-content\themes\<Your Theme's Root Folder>\react-src`
  - Mac or \*nix example: `cd /xampp/htdocs/wordpress/wp-content/themes/<Your Theme's Root Folder>/react-src`
- Create a new folder to hold you're development SSL certificate and key.
  - All OSes: `mkdir ssl`
- Change directory into the `ssl` folder
  - All OSes `cd ssl`
- Then create the SSL certificate and key.
  - Windows: Install the [Linux Subsystem for Windows 10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10), then use the \*nix instructions below.
  - Mac, see here: https://ksearch.wordpress.com/2017/08/22/generate-and-import-a-self-signed-ssl-certificate-on-mac-osx-sierra/
  - \*nix, see here (**also works with Linux Subsystem for Windows 10**): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10175812/how-to-create-a-self-signed-certificate-with-openssl
- Depending on which process you use to create the certificate and key, the files you created might have different extensions than those mentioned below.
  - That's OK.
  - Sometimes both files have a `.pem` extension, or each file has a different extension like `.crt` and `.key`.
  - **Just be sure you know which file is the certificate and which is the key.**
- There is a file named `user.dev.json` in the folder named `react-src` in your theme.
  - Open that file in your favorite text editor.
  - Change the "wpThemeServer" section to look like this (make sure it is proper JSON):
  - `"wpThemeServer": { "enable": true, "host": "127.0.0.1", "port": 8090, "sslCert": "ssl/localhost.crt", "sslKey": "ssl/localhost.key", "watchFile": "../index.php" },`
  - **NOTE** the `sslCert` and `sslKey` items. **Make sure the values point to your SSL certificate and key files.**
  - The paths to those files can be **full paths** or **relative paths** from the `react-src` folder (as shown above).
  - I like to set the `host` to `127.0.0.1` instead of "localhost". Supposedly the numeric address gets special treatment at the OS level as being mostly safe.
- Back in your command prompt, change dir back to the `react-src` folder.
  - All OSes: `cd ..`
- Start Node/Webpack JS watcher as you normally would:
  - All OSes: `npm run start`
  - Your theme should open in a new browser tab
- If you need to add an SSL exception to your browser for your new certificate, there is a page running over HTTPS at the "host" and "port" you set in `user.dev.json` above.
  - For example, if you're using host `127.0.0.1` and port `8090` as shown above, then open your browser to:
    - https<nolink>://127.0.0.1:8090/
  - From there you'll get the standard browser warning about self-signed certificates and get the option to add an exception.
  - Once you've finished adding an exception to your browser, you'll need to refresh the tab with your development theme to force a reconnect to the `Browser Refresh Server`.

## Deploying Your Theme

While you're actively developing your theme, the files are not optimized for production. Before you put your theme into production, you need to run the `build` command.

Open a command prompt and change into the `react-src` folder of you theme and run this command:
`npm run build`

When that command finishes, your optimized files are located in a folder that can be deployed to your production server.

Here's an example showing which folder to deploy to your server:

- ...wp-content
  - themes
    - my-theme
      - my-theme `<- deploy this folder to your production server's themes folder`
      - react-src
      - !READY_TO_DEPLOY!.txt

If you need to continue developing your theme, simply:

- `cd react-src`
- `npm run start`

And all your theme files will reappear.

### Dealing With Differing Paths Between DEV and PROD

The `react-src/user.prod.json` configuration file is read when you run `npm run build`. The only option in there is setting the "homepage"
which controls the relative linking to files in your theme. The "homepage" setting in your main `package.json` file is used during development (and build by default).

During development, this is probably what you want. But **if you know your production server has a different root**, then you can set the homepage to be different during a production build.

For example:

- Your WordPress dev server is running at http<nolink>://localhost/wordpress
  - the homepage setting in your main package.json file will probably work just fine.
  - The homepage line in your main package.json will be something like: `"homepage": "/wordpress/wp-content/themes/<Your Theme's Root Folder>"`
- But you know that your production server runs WordPress from the root: http<nolink>://mycoolblog.com/
  - In this case you want to remove the `/wordpress` part, so set the "homepage" line in your `user.prod.json` file to:
    `"homepage": "/wp-content/themes/<Your Theme's Root Folder>"`
  - Then run `npm run build`
  - **Note** at this point, **your theme will appear broken on your dev server**. But it should look as expected on your production server.

## Goals

- Remove WebPackDevServer and use your WordPress dev server instead.
  - Also, do not proxy the WordPress server.
  - Thus removing CORS as a concern.
- Maintain feature parity(ish) with `create-react-app`
- Touch the original `react-scripts` as little as possible.
  - Add new files where possible.
  - This will make merges easier.
