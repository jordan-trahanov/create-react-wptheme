# cra-template-wptheme

This is the official base template for [Create React WPTheme](https://github.com/jordan-trahanov/create-react-wptheme).

# Create React WP Theme

See the latest [README](https://github.com/jordan-trahanov/create-react-wptheme) on Github.

## Goals

- Remove WebPackDevServer and use your WordPress dev server instead.
  - Also, do not proxy the WordPress server.
  - Thus removing CORS as a concern.
- Maintain feature parity(ish) with `create-react-app`
- Touch the original `react-scripts` as little as possible.
  - Add new files where possible.
  - This will make merges easier.

## Acknowledgements

I'm grateful to the authors of existing related projects for their ideas and collaboration:

- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

  The original.

- [filewatcher-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/filewatcher-webpack-plugin)

  I used this as an example for writing my own plugin for watching changes to the create-react-app "public" folder.
