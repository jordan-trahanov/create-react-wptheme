# Create React WP Theme

## Up To Date!

Apr. 15, 2020
<br />
Facebook recently released [v3.4.1](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/releases/tag/v3.4.1) of [Create-React-App](https://create-react-app.dev/).

And now `create-react-wptheme` is up-to-date.<br>
If you have a theme made with an earlier version of `create-react-wptheme` and want to update it to the latest code, [just follow these instructions](#updating-existing-themes).

## Getting Started

[Michael Soriano](https://github.com/michaelsoriano) is writing a tutorial for creating a theme using React. He uses `create-react-wptheme` for the initial setup. He provides a lot more detail than this `readme` and the screen shots are really helpful.

See the full [README](https://github.com/jordan-trahanov/create-react-wptheme) on Github.

## Goals

- Remove WebPackDevServer and use your WordPress dev server instead.
  - Also, do not proxy the WordPress server.
  - Thus removing CORS as a concern.
- Maintain feature parity(ish) with `create-react-app`
- Touch the original `react-scripts` as little as possible.
  - Add new files where possible.
  - This will make merges easier.

## Acknowledgements

I'm grateful to the authors of existing related projects for their ideas and collaboration:

- [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)

  The original.

- [filewatcher-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/filewatcher-webpack-plugin)

  I used this as an example for writing my own plugin for watching changes to the create-react-app "public" folder.
